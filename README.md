# SU(2) x SU(2)

This python package offers efficient simulation and data analysis routines for the SU(2) x SU(2) Principal Chiral model. The key feature offered is the integration of Fourier Acceleration into the Hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm which leads to a significant reduction in the degree of critical slowing down.

Currently the simulation is only supported for a two dimensional cubic lattice.
